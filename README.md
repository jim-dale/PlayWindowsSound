# PlaySound

Play one of the built in Windows system sounds

``` Batchfile
PlaySound [SystemSoundName] [-l]
```

-l List supported system sound names

Where \[SystemSoundName\] is one of

* SystemAsterisk
* SystemDefault
* SystemExclamation
* SystemExit
* SystemHand
* SystemQuestion
* SystemStart
* SystemWelcome

**It appears that when running on Windows 10 all the sounds are the same.
So the \[SystemSoundName\] parameter is irrelevant.**
